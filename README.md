# Personal Portfolio

<p> My personal objective in regard to this project was to create a whole new web page from scratch to start the foundation for showing off my coding skills. 
</p>

<p>
I created an html fairly easily, but the css flexbox features gave me a heck of a time. I think if I had time to start it all over, I might. In the end I could not get one single image to format properly at smaller browser widths and ran out of time to fix the issue. 
</p>

<p>
 The time spent on the project taught me most of the basics of flexbox.
